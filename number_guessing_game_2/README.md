# Number Guessing Game

## Description

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The user thinks of a number between 1 and 1000, and the computer attempts to guess it. After each guess, the user provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the computer correctly guesses the number.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Think of a number between 1 and 1000.
3. Press Enter to start the guessing process.
4. The program will make a guess and prompt you to provide feedback:
   - Type `too high` if the guess is greater than your number.
   - Type `too low` if the guess is less than your number.
   - Type `you won` if the guess is correct.
5. The computer will adjust its guesses based on your feedback and continue guessing until it finds the correct number.

## Features

- **Binary Search Algorithm:** Efficiently narrows down the possible range of numbers.
- **Interactive Feedback:** Adjusts guesses based on user input.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple prompts for user interaction.

## Example Usage

### When you run the game, you might see an interaction like this:

- Think about a number between 1 and 1000, and let me guess it! Hit enter to continue! <user presses Enter>

- Guessing: 500 Is my guess too high, too low, or did I win? too high

- Guessing: 250 Is my guess too high, too low, or did I win? too low

- Guessing: 375 Is my guess too high, too low, or did I win? you won

- Great, humanity will never win against silicon!


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Save the script as `guessing_game.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script using the command:

   ```bash
