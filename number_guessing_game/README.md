# Number Guessing Game

## Description

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. The program will prompt you to guess the number.
3. Enter a number between 1 and 100.
4. The program will tell you if your guess is too small, too big, or correct.
5. If your guess is correct, the program will display "You win!" and terminate.

## Features

- Input validation: The program checks whether the entered value is a number.
- Infinite guessing attempts until the correct number is guessed.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.
