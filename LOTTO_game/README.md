# LOTTO Game

## Description

This is a simple LOTTO game implemented in Python. The user is prompted to enter six unique numbers between 1 and 49. The computer then randomly selects six unique numbers within the same range. The game compares the user's numbers with the computer's numbers, displays any common numbers, and announces "LOTTO!" if all numbers match.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Enter your name when prompted.
3. Input six unique numbers between 1 and 49.
4. The program will display your sorted numbers and the computer's random numbers.
5. The program will show the common numbers between your guess and the computer's draw.
6. If your numbers match the computer's numbers exactly, you will see "LOTTO!" printed.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for number input.
- Validates and ensures the uniqueness of the numbers entered by the user.
- Sorts and displays both user and computer numbers.
